   </style>

5. downloaded the snow.jpg from unsplash and added some css background styling
   justified content to center including display flex
6. next we did was to create classes and ids for paragraph and span (days,hours
   ,mins and seconds)

7. next is to pick one of our classes which is the general countdown container and style, also check out how we styled and positioned some other components

8. next is javascript.note; new date gives you current date , you can try it..so with this you can add and subtract dates in functions too

9. when we console.log(newYearsDate - currentDate); this, we need to convert the result to days, hours etc....this comes as milliseconds, so we divide by 1000 to
   get seconds
10. look out our total milliseconds left after substract from current date.. now
    do the maths of converting each to days,hours,nibutes and seconds..

11. what next, we did document get element by id and also did innerhtml with our already calculated consts.

12. we added a function to help add a zero when ever a counter has a single digit
